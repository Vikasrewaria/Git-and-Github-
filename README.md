Question.1:- Explain what version control is and its important in software development.
Solution:- Version control is a system that tracks changes to a set of files over time.It allows developers to see who made what changes and when, and to revert to previous version of the code of needed. Version control is essential for software development because it allows teams to collaborate on the same project without stepping on each other's toes.
<b> Here are some of its important in software development-<b>
.Collaboration:- Makes it easy for multiple developes to work on the same project at the same time. Developers can create their orn branches of the code to work on new features or fix bugs, and then merge their changes back into the main codebase once they are complete.
.History:- Keeps a complete history of all changes to the code. This makes it easy to track down the source of a bug or to revert to a previous version of the code if necessary.
.Backup:- serves as a backup for the code. If a developer accidentally delets a file or makes a mistake, they can easily restore the file or revert to a previous version of the code.
.Auditing:- It can be used to audit changes to the code. This can be helpful for tracking down security vulnerabilities or for complying with regulations.

Question.2:- Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository.
Solution:-  The git workflow is a set of steps and stages that developers follow to manage and track changes effectively using Git, a popular version control system. It involves three main components: the working directory, the staging area (also known as the index), and the repository.

1. Working Directory:- The working directory is the local file system where you create, edit, and organize your projects files. When you initiate a Git repository in a deirectory, it becomes a part of the working directory.
